# YOLOv5
⭐️About this repository
A YOLOv5 guide is developed to provide you a step by step through the process of getting you up and running with Yolov5 and creating your own detection on your Window machine.
A youtube video is also created, so you can use it along with the video - 

🚀What is YOLOv5? 
YOLOv5 is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.

🚀Why YOLOv5? 
YOLOv5 is the Leader in Realtime Object Detection, because of PyTorch implementation, fast in speed, high in accuracy and light in size.
